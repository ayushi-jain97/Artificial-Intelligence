# Artificial-Intelligence

## Prerequisites
* Python Programming
* Machine Learning - Supervised - Regression, classification
* Logic - Truth Tables

## MultiVariate Linear Regression
* It consists of a straightforward implementation of Gradient Descent and its modification to support Binary Classification problems
* Familiarize yourself with Sigmoid/ Logistic function and its properties
* Change the number of iterations and learning rate to observe convergence

_Run from terminal_
```python
python gradientDescent.py
python logisticRegression.py
```

## Logic
#### Propositional Logic
* It consists of implementations of Truth Tables and checking for tautologies, self-contradictions, contingencies, equivalnces, logical entailment and consistency
* This is not an efficient method for evaluating compound sentences with a large number of logical constants
* Evaluation (checking whether a truth assignment satisifies a given compound logical statement) is done by first converting the infix expression to its postfix version and finally evaluating using a stack. 
* Built in function _eval_ can be used for evaluation.
